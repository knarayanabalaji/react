 React.createElement gives ReactElement(which is JS Object) and it is rendered as HTMLElement

 
 JSX - HTML like or XML like syntax
 JSX (code is transpiled into regular js code before it is executed into the browser)- it is done by PARCEL - Babel.
 Babel - (converts JSX code to react code).
 Babel - Put in next-gen JavaScript --> Get browser-compatible JavaScript out.
 JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement- JS Object => HTMLElement(render).
 Attribute in JSX should be in camelCase format.
 JSX expression can have only one parent element.
 ex: 
 <div id="container-1">
    <h1>Container 1</h1>
    <Title/>
    <Title></Title>
    {Title()}
    { jsxHeading}
    <h2>{number}</h2>
    <h1>Namaste React Functional Component 🚀</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="container-2">
            <h1>Container 2</h1>
    </div>

    in the above example we have two div's in parent level so this throws an error. we can overcome this by using <React.Fragment> :

    <React.Fragment>
   <div id="container-1">
    <h1>Container 1</h1>
    <Title/>
    <Title></Title>
    {Title()}
    { jsxHeading}
    <h2>{number}</h2>
    <h1>Namaste React Functional Component 🚀</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="container-2">
            <h1>Container 2</h1>
    </div>
    </React.Fragment>

    (or)

     <>
   <div id="container-1">
    <h1>Container 1</h1>
    <Title/>
    <Title></Title>
    {Title()}
    { jsxHeading}
    <h2>{number}</h2>
    <h1>Namaste React Functional Component 🚀</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="container-2">
            <h1>Container 2</h1>
    </div>
    </>


 React components:
 React components - everything is components in react
Two types of components in react => 
1. class based components
2. Funtional components 



Functional component:
It is just normal javascript function.
a Functional component is normal javascript function which returns some piece of JSX.
A JS function which returns a react element is called functional component.

Note:
When we create any functional component or any react component we need to name it with capital letter.

it can be written in two ways:
1. const HeadingComponent = () =>{
    return <h1> Namaste</h1>
}
2. const HeadingComponent = () =>( <h1>Namaste</h1>) 

what is component composition in react?
components inside components is called component composition
                  (or)
composing two components into one another is called component composition
ex: 
const Title = () => {
    return <h1>Namaste React🙏</h1>
}

const HeadingComponent = () =>{
   return  <div id="container">
    <Title/>
    <Title></Title>
    {Title()}
    <h1>Namaste React Functional Component 🚀</h1>
    </div>
}

in the above example title component is composed inside HeadingComponent.


If we want to write any javascript code inside jsx we can write it inside curly braces i.e {}
